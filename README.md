# testrepo

A few examples of basic selenium actions performed using VS C#

*also used to test pushing to a new repo from vs*

* Steps
1 - create a new repo in git hub ( don init with a read me)
2 - copy the remote repo url
3 - in VS(2015) pubish to the remote repo url
  this will automotically perform a 1st commit to the remote repo. ( it adds a default note of 'adding project files when doing this)
